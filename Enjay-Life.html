<h3>About</h3>

<p>“Success is not to discover what others like, it is to acquire and practice the skills that help one gain their love.”</p>

<p>“Bravery is not to persist in your errors, but to acknowledge that you are wrong, and not to repeat the error again.”</p>
    
   <p>“When people realize that we pay attention to their good actions just as we pay attention to their bad actions, they appreciate our advice.”</p>
